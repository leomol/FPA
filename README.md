# Fiber photometry analysis
MATLAB scripts to plot data from a fiber photometry recording.

## Prerequisites
- [MATLAB][MATLAB] (last tested with R2022a)

## Installation
- Install [MATLAB][MATLAB] with the following toolboxes:
	- Curve Fitting Toolbox
	- Signal Processing Toolbox
	- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Download and extract the [FPA library][FPA] to the `Documents/MATLAB` folder

## Usage
- Run `startup.m` to add FPA dependencies to the MATLAB search path.
- See and edit examples according to your experimental setup.


### Script
```matlab
fpa = FPA(time, signal, reference, configuration);
fpa.plot();
```

### GUI
The GUI is under development and has limitted functionality compared to the script.

```matlab
GUI();
```

Remove baseline from data, correct from motion artifacts; normalize, filter, and detect peaks of spontaneous activity in user defined epochs.

## Analysis
Processing steps:
- Resample data to a given frequency.
- Replace artifacts with linear interpolation in flagged regions.
- Baseline correction modeled as an exponential decay of the low-pass filtered data.
- Correct for motion artifacts by subtracting reference to signal, after a polynomial fit.
- Remove fast oscillations with a low-pass filter.
- Normalize data as df/f or z-score according to settings.
- Find peaks of spontaneous activity in low-pass filtered data.
- Figure 1:
  - Raw signal and reference, and baseline model.
  - Baseline corrected signal and reference.
  - Motion correction.
  - Normalization.
  - Peaks.
- Figure 2:
  - Power spectrum for each epoch.
- Figure 3:
  - Boxplot.
- Remaining figures:
  - Peak triggers, event-triggers, epoch start-triggers, and epoch stop-triggers.
  - Triggered average of peaks (if any), event-triggers, epoch start, and epoch stop.

## Configuration

`configuration` is a struct with the following fields (defaults are used for missing fields):
- `conditionEpochs` - Epochs for different conditions: `{'epoch1', [start1, end1, start2, end2, ...], 'epoch2', ...}`
- `baselineEpochs` - Time epochs (s) to include for baseline correction.
- `thresholdEpochs`
- `baselineLowpassFrequency` - Frequency representative of baseline.
- `airPLS` - Baseline correction for all data using airPLS (true, false, or airPLS inputs).
- `artifactEpochs` - Time epochs (s) to remove.
- `resamplingFrequency` - Resampling frequency (Hz).
- `lowpassFrequency` - Lowest frequency permitted in normalized signal.
- `peaksLowpassFrequency` - Lowest frequency to detect peaks.
- `triggeredWindow` - Length of time to capture around each peak of spontaneous activity.
- `fitReference` - Shift and scale reference to fit signal.

Also see [normalization](#Normalization-recipes) and [thresholding](#Thresholding) configurations below.

See source code for default values:
```matlab
edit('FPA');
```

Units for time and frequency are seconds and hertz respectively.

## Normalization recipes

Normalization is calculated as `(f - f0) / f1` where `f0` and `f1` can be data provided by the user or calculated using given functions:

### f0 and f1 are common to all datapoints and calculated from all data:
#### df/f:
```matlab
configuration.f0 = @mean;
configuration.f1 = @mean;
```

#### z-score:
```matlab
configuration.f0 = @mean;
configuration.f1 = @std;
```

#### z-score - alternative 1 (default):
```matlab
configuration.f0 = @median;
configuration.f1 = @mad;
```

#### z-score - alternative 2:
```matlab
configuration.f0 = @median;
configuration.f1 = @std;
```

### f0 and f1 are common to all data points and calculated at given epochs:
#### df/f:
```matlab
epochs = [0, 100, 500, 550, 1000, Inf]
configuration.f0 = {@mean, epochs};
configuration.f1 = {@mean, epochs};
```

### f0 and f1 are calculated for each data point based on a moving window:
#### df/f:
```matlab
window = 60;
configuration.f0 = {@movmean, window};
configuration.f1 = {@movmean, window};
```

[further combinations possible with `@movmean`, `@movmedian`, `@movstd`, `@movmad`, `@mov`...].

### Normalization from given data:
```matlab
f0 = ones(size(time));
f1 = ones(size(time)) * 10;
configuration.f0 = f0;
configuration.f1 = f1;
```


## Thresholding
Fluorescence deflections are maximum local points separated by a minimum distance (`peakSeparation`) and with a minimum height or prominence (`peakDetectionMode`), provided in one of two ways:

### Threshold as a raw value:
```matlab
  configuration.threshold = value;
```
#### Example 1 - Only peaks exceeding the value 2.91 are included:
```matlab
  configuration.threshold = 2.91;
```

### Threshold as a result of applying a function to the data (within `thresholdEpochs`):
```matlab
  configuration.threshold = userDefinedFunction;
```
#### Example 1 - 2.91 median absolute deviations from the median:
```matlab
  configuration.threshold = @(data) 2.91 * mad(data) + median(data);
```
#### Example 2 - 2.00 standard deviations from the mean:
```matlab
  configuration.threshold = @(data) 2.00 * std(data) + mean(data);
```

## Data loaders
### Load a CSV file (e.g. data acquired with Doric, Multifiber, or Inscopix DAQ)
```matlab
[data, names] = loadData(filename)
```

Returns a `data` matrix where columns correspond to channels listed in `names`, that is, time followed by other data columns.

Expected format #1:

| time | name 1 | name 2 | ... | name N |
|:----:|:-----: |:------:|:---:|:------:|
|  t1  |   a1   |   b2   | ... |   zN   |
|  ... |   ...  |  ....  | ... |   ...  |
|  tM  |   aM   |   bM   | ... |   zM   |

Expected format #2:

|      | name 1 | name 2 | ... | name N |
|:----:|:-----: |:------:|:---:|:------:|
| time | accepted\|rejected | accepted\|rejected | ... | accepted\|rejected |
|  t1  |   a1   |   b2   | ... |   zN   |
|  ... |   ...  |  ....  | ... |   ...  |
|  tM  |   aM   |   bM   | ... |   zM   |

### Load an XLS or XLSX file (e.g. data acquired with Doric or Inscopix DAQ)
```matlab
[data, names, sheetName] = loadData(filename, <sheetNumber|sheetName>)
```

Returns a `data` matrix where columns correspond to channels listed in `names`. A sheet number or a sheet name can be passed as the second parameter (default is the first sheet in the document). The sheet name is also returned.

Expected format for each sheed in a document:

| time | name 1 | name 2 | ... | name N |
|:----:|:-----: |:------:|:---:|:------:|
|  t1  |   a1   |   b2   | ... |   zN   |
|  ... |   ...  |  ....  | ... |   ...  |
|  tM  |   aM   |   bM   | ... |   zM   |

### Load an `abf` datafile acquired with Axon DAQ
```matlab
[data, units, names] = loadABF(filename)
```

### Load a data folder acquired with TDT DAQ
```matlab
[data, names] = loadTDT(folder)
```

Parses a project folder stored by a TDT DAQ and returns a `data` matrix where columns correspond to channels listed in `names`.

### Load LabChart data
```matlab
[time, data, units, names, comments] = loadLabChart(filename)
```
Loads a `mat` file exported by LabChart in an intuitive manner.

```matlab
[time, data, units, names] = loadAdicht(filename)
```
Loads an `aditch` file.

Data are organized in 2D cells where row indices select channels and column indices select blocks:
```matlab
    time{channel, block}
    data{channel, block}
```

Units are organized in a cell array where row indices select channels and column indices select blocks:
   - Data units:
```matlab
    units{channel, block}
```
  
Channel names are organized in a cell array:
```matlab
    names{channel}
```

### Load TTL data logged by Inscopix DAQ

epochs = loadCleverSys(filename, <sheet>)
```

Returns a list of event epochs generated by CleverSys.
